# Rust Runtime for JavaScript Plugins

This project is a simple demo created for fun by a Rust learner.

**Disclaimer**

Please note that this repository is a personal learning project and should be viewed as such. The code and design presented here are the result of my ongoing exploration of Rust and its integration with JavaScript plugins. I am aware that this demo may not reflect professional standards or best practices, and it is not intended to be a production-ready solution. My primary goal in sharing this project is to document my learning process and to encourage others who are also new to Rust to experiment and learn without fear of making mistakes.

I kindly ask that visitors and reviewers approach this repository with understanding and respect. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but I hope that no one will use this demo as an opportunity for ridicule or sarcasm. Every developer starts somewhere, and the journey of learning a new language or technology is filled with trial and error. This demo is a snapshot of my progress at this stage, and I am continuously working to improve my skills.

If you find issues, inefficiencies, or unconventional approaches in the code, please remember that this is a work in progress and not a reflection of professional expertise. I appreciate any suggestions for improvement, but I ask that criticism be delivered in a supportive and considerate manner. The purpose of this repository is to foster a positive learning environment, both for myself and for others who may be inspired to begin their own journey with Rust.

Thank you for taking the time to view my project. Your understanding and encouragement are greatly appreciated.
